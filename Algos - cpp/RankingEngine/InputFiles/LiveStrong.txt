Tennis ball manufacturers mold rubber into two shapes that are pressed together to form the core of a ball. To achieve an appropriate level of bounciness, tennis ball makers inject a specific amount of pressurized air into the center of each rubber core. Manufacturers buff the sealed, pressurized rubber balls and cover them in glue. Machines cut long pieces of bright yellow felt into two shapes that are wrapped around each tennis ball to form a covering. Ball makers heat the completed tennis balls to make the glue form a seal that holds the two pieces of fabric together.
