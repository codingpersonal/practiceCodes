With the match squarely in the balance, Federer's last eight shots of the game, spanning three points, were all backhands. Federer hit seven of the eight as a defensive slice, and two of them crucially missed their mark.

It was the pressure of Djokovics smothering baseline game that was the dominant factor more than anything Federer did technically or tactically wrong. Saving the break point enabled the Serb to squarely grasp the momentum, and break Federer in the next game to secure the opening set.

While winners and unforced errors are always calculated on a stat sheet, its the forced errors that matters the most, offering a repeatable pathway to secure victory at all levels of the game.
